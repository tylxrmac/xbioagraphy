   <h1>1925</h1>
   <h2>Malcolm X was Born Omaha, NE</h2>
   <div class="container">
   <p>May 19: Malcolm X is born Malcolm Little in Omaha, Nebraska, the fourth of Earl and<br> Louise Little’s seven children.

   <br><h1>1939</h1>
   <h2>Separation of the Littles</h2>
   <div class="container">
   
   <p>The state places the Little children with various foster families, and Malcolm, who<br> has been kicked out of school in the seventh grade, is sent to a juvenile home in the<br> nearly all-white community of Mason, Michigan. He does well at school there, <br>earning straight A’s and being elected president of his 8th-grade class,<br> but his teacher discourages him about pursuing his goal of becoming a lawyer.

   <br><h1>1946</h1>
   <h2>Trouble Brews</h2>
   <div class="container">
   <p>January: Malcolm tries to retrieve a stolen $1000 watch from a <br>pawnshop and is arrested and charged with grand larceny, breaking and entering, <br>and firearms possession. He is convicted and, along with Jarvis, receives an<br> eight-to-10-year sentence. The white women have their sentences suspended,<br> but Malcolm’s girlfriend serves seven months in prison. The women<br> refused the police suggestion to charge Malcolm and Malcolm Jarvis with rape.

   <br><h1>1952</h1>
   <h2>Enlightenment</h2>
   <div class=" container">
   <p> Malcolm is released on parole, spends one night with Ella Collins, then goes to<br> Detroit to live with his brother Wilfred. He quickly joins the Nation <br>of Islam and attendsmeetings at Detroit’s Temple No. 1, one of the four temples that the<br> Nation operates at the time. <br>Malcolm rejects the surname “Little” as a slave name given to his family<br> by white oppressors, and he becomes known as “Malcolm X.”  </p></div>
